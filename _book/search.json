    "text": "Personal introduction\nHello! My name’s Hannah and this is my Quarto learning diary for CASA0023.\nFor a bit of background on me; I’m currently enrolled on the Social and Geographic Data Science MSc programme at UCL, but come from a background in Physical Geography after graduating from the University of Edinburgh in 2023. I was first introduced to remote sensing during my undergrad which saw many projects focus on remotely sensing forests and green spaces across Scotland. After a gentle introduction to different sensors, programs and earth-focused applications in the first couple years, I sought more opportunities to combine my primary research interest, the cryosphere, with remote sensing. Fortunately for me the two go increasingly hand-in-hand and as a result my final two years in Edinburgh were focused almost entirely on remote sensing of cold places. My dissertation saw me map ice algal blooms across the Greenland Ice Sheet using Sentinel-3 imagery and this remains my magnum opus (I joke - the maps I made were extremely basic and honestly quite ugly so looking back on it now makes me laugh because I’ve learnt so much in the past year).\nI’ve also worked for two companies as a remote sensing intern/geospatial analyst which taught me a great deal; the first was Space Intelligence in Edinburgh and the other was CF Partners in London. At Space Intelligence I worked on a land cover classification project the company had been awarded by the Tanzanian government looking to monitor deforestation, whilst at CF I was thrown in the deep end with SAR interferometry and Google Earth Engine to produce a forestry-related machine learning model. Before this point, almost all of my interactions with remotely sensed data had been during solo projects for uni, so it was cool to see what working in a team was like during these professional experiences. I found myself learning a lot in a very short amount of time and I was actually quite sad when the time came to leave both companies.\nThis jumble of academic and professional experiences has exposed me to quite a range of data products (Sentinel-1,2,3, Landsat, WorldView, MODIS etc.) and applications (ENVI, GEE, Arc+QGIS, SNAP etc.), not to mention the associated headaches and frustrations that come with working in the field. These headaches seem not to have put me off though as I selected this course keen not just to learn more about specific remote sensing techniques, but also to think about their applications in urban contexts. My undergrad was very quantitative and environment-focused which left me often looking down on anything even vaguely ‘human’ or development based. I’d like to challenge that naive perception throughout this course and learn more about how the techniques I’m already familiar with can be used to support cities and the people who live in them.\nI hope you enjoy reading my learning diary!"

All of this was used to demonstrate that there is no one sensor for all applications - the kind of research you’re undertaking will dictate which sensor and what kind of data is appropriate.

    "section": "1.2 Applications",
    "text": "1.2 Applications\nComing from a background in remote sensing for environmental monitoring that has seen me use SNAP & R quite extensively, I decided it best to dedicate my study time in week 1 to consider applications of remote sensing data that I was unfamiliar with. Quite often during my undergraduate degree I found myself falling into a trap of believing that anything that lay beyond the confines of strictly quantitative and highly scientific research was a waste of time and not worth paying attention to. Only now that I’ve graduated am I realising how narrow-minded and naive this perspective is; it really came to mind when during the lecture we were reminded that given the plethora of potential applications of remotely sensed data, there is no singular best sensor or optimum spatial/spectral/temporal resolution. \nSo, in an attempt to fix my old way of thinking, I am starting off CASA0023 and this learning diary by researching applications of remote sensing that sit beyond the confines of physical geography. To have some fun with it, I decided to try and find an example of a time remotely sensed data was used to address an unusual topic for every letter of the alphabet. I used a random word generator (https://randomwordgenerator.com/) to offer me a word which served as the starting point of my research. Below I have provided a brief description of articles that I came across during my research, many of which prompted me to fall down a rabbit hole of literature that I’d never come across before.\n\nABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUvWXYZ\n\n\nAdolescent vulnerability in Indonesia: Toharudin et al., 2017\nToharudin et al., 2017 examined mental health issues in adolescents in Indonesia by combining a variety of variables including mobile phone usage, emotional disorder classifications, travel experiences as well as night light remote sensing data to see how behavioural disorders varied between young people in urban versus rural areas.\n\n\nClassifying punches in Olympic boxing using static RGB cameras: Stefański et al., 2023\nStefański et al., 2023 sought to propose a solution to address current issues regarding the classification of punches in Olympic boxing by using static RGB cameras opposite the ring to track and then classify athlete moves. This challenged conventional approaches to track athletes in combat sports that see athletes require wearable sensors.\n\n\nOn-site cocaine detection with an integrated near-infrared spectral sensor: Kranenburg et al., 2022\nIn response to the all-time high of illegal drug production/trafficking/seizures/usage, Kranenburg et al., 2022 explore the concept of an on-site drug detection device that uses a NIR spectral sensor that can be integrated into a smart phone. Their testing found the sensor to successfully exploit an array of resonant-cavity enhanced photodetectors to correctly classify 11 common illicit drugs 100% of the time. This is achieved by chemometric modelling of the response of 15 wavelength-specific pixels (chemometric is just a fancy word for mathematical methods that analyse chemical data).\n\n\nDinosaur fossils discovered using remotely piloted aircraft systems: Herridge-Berry et al., 2021\nDigging for dinosaur remains is limited by the typically inaccessible terrain surrounding potential archeological sites. Herridge-Berry et al., 2021 however offer a proof-of-concept test for the remote sensing of fossils (specifically ‘vertebrate boneheads’) in Dinosaur Provincial Park, Alberta as the case study. Due to the small size of most fossils, they suggest using Spectral Mixture Analysis after collecting data obtained by deploying a RGB camera onto a plane flying over a study site.\n\n\nAdvancing the egg industry using non-destructive optical sensing technologies: Ahmed et al. 2023\nIn acknowledgement of eggs being one of the best sources of protein and one of the most popular foods worldwide, Ahmed et al. 2023 wrote a review of ways in which technologies including satellites in space and remote sensors are currently used (and can in future be used) to turn the current egg industry into ‘Industry 4.0’.\n\n\nPredicting the distribution potential of an invasive frog in Hawaii using remotely sensed data: Bisrat et al., 2011\nBisrat et al., 2011 used 5 biophysical variables derived from MODIS as predictors for the potential distribution of Eleutherodactylus coqui (commonly known as the coqui frog), a species native to Puerto Rico but non-native and dangerous to ecological systems in Hawaii.\n\n\nIntegrating remote sensing for mapping garbage dump areas in Bahrain: Al-Joburi, 2017\nGarbage dumping is a prevalent issue in Bahrain, associated with worrying economic and environmental consequences. In response to this issue, Al-Joburi, 2017 was able to identify, locate and map possible garbage dump sites using Landsat imagery spanning 1972 to the present day.\n\n\nRemote sensing via hot air balloon across Yellowstone National Park: Planer-Friedrich et al. 2006\nTwo rapidly changing hydrothermal areas in Yellowstone National Park required mapping and monitoring, however limited budgets, a lack of personnel trained in remote sensing and strict unmanned UAV rules in USA were holding back observation efforts and management strategy implementation. Planer-Friedrich et al. 2006 responded to this by using a hot air balloon to take photos from above the areas.\n\n\nEstimating the population size of endangered iguanas in the Galápagos using drones: Varela-Jaramillo et al., 2023\nVarela-Jaramillo et al., 2023 outline the development of a drone-based method for the estimation of population size in Galápagos marine iguanas, Amblyrhynchus cristatus, finding drone-based surveys to outperform ground-based counts in all tests.\n\n\nMicrowave remote sensing of Jupiter’s atmosphere from an orbiting spacecraft: Janssen et al., 2005\nJanssen et al., 2005 demonstrate the promise of passive microwave sounding via an orbiting spacecraft to determine deep water stores in Jupiter to an accuracy that enables the discrimination of models for Jupiter’s origin.\n\n\nEstimating the Leaf Area Index (LAI) for ketchup farms using remote sensing images: Dorneles et al., 2023\nLAI is one of the main physiological parameters of the plant related to transpiration, productivity and rainfall interception. Dorneles et al., 2023 sought to measure LAI of an industrial tomato field used in ketchup production in Brazil using Sentinel-2 images so as to incorporate the parameter into improved agricultural efficiency plans.\n\n\nSatellite remote sensing informing evidence based action against forced labour camps: Boyd et al., 2018\nBoyd et al., 2018 use WorldView imagery available on Google Earth geobrowser to identify and estimate the number of brick kilns across the ‘Brick Belt’ that runs across south Asia - kilns which are known sites of modern day slavery.\n\n\nRemote sensing in movies\nAs a big movie fan, it felt only right to give Will Smith’s 1998 Enemy of the State a mention; a film which is an attempt (albeit incredibly over-the-top) the demonstrate the power of remote sensing and satellites. It’s a surveillance police state thriller which has all kinds of scenes which see satellite imagery used to track fugitives across the US.\n\n\nEstimating chlorophyll concentration in conifer needles: Moorthy et al., 2008\nNo longer is it impossible to find a needle in a haystack; Moorthy et al., 2008 were able to detect and measure the chlorophyll concentration in Jack Pine needles, a dominant Boreal forest species using Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI) observations obtained in the visible-near infrared domain across 8 sites in Ontario, Canada.\n\n\nEstimating the phenological stages of oranges in Iranian orchards using remote sensing: Hashemi et al., 2021\nHashemi et al., 2021 looked to better constrain the growth of orange trees to improve agricultural models and production lines by utilising MODIS images to track the phenological stages of crops across the southeast of Fars Province in Iran.\n\n\nTracking pirates from space: Shortland, 2012\nPiracy off the shores of Somalia remains a significant issue; one which requires a land-based solution. Shortland, 2012 approaches this by suggesting a host of solutions, all of which use a variety of satellite remote sensing based methods. These look at both tracking ships remotely, as well as looking at night-time light data to pinpoint suspected beneficiaries of piracy ransom money.\n\n\nReducing traffic queue times using satellite imagery: Leitloff et al., 2005\nLeitloff et al., 2005 utilised the fine 1 metre resolution of QuickBird imagery to detect vehicle queues in urban areas to demonstrate the opportunities to use this information to reroute traffic and reduce queuing time.\n\n\nRemote sensors as an integral element of modern race car driving: Wojciechowski & Wojtowicz, 2023\nWojciechowski & Wojtowicz, 2023 describe the over 250 active remote sensors placed on Formula 1 cars during Grand Prix races that allow teams to generate over 500GB of data. Each sensor is assigned to one of three categories: control, instrumentation, and monitoring.\n\n\nAdvancements in remote sensing facilitating improved oil spill surveillance: Jha et al., 2007 \nOil spill surveillance constitutes an important component of oil spill disaster management. Jha et al., 2007 reviewed the benefits of various remote sensors and satellites that are currently employed in surveillance efforts; an integral part of environmental management and industrial accountability.\n\n\nEstimation of tree cover using MODIS data at global, continental and regional/local scales: Hansen et al., 2005\nIt would be wrong to include anything other than trees for T, and Hansen et al., 2005 research which utilised MODIS data to map tree covers at different scales of study.\n\n\nManaging urbanisation using remote sensing: Rosni et al., 2016\nRosni et al., 2016 monitor urban sprawl across Kuala Lumpur metropolitan area using SPOT-5 images to demonstrate the rapid urbanisation rate affecting Indonesia.\n\n\nDetection of submerged ocean vessels using remote sensing techniques: Wren et al., 1997\nWren et al., 1997 described how remote sensing techniques can provide not only an aid but also a valuable alternative to approaches at detecting and recovering submerged vessels. Specifically, they identify the value of elevated sensors on Low Earth Orbit satellites as a powerful tool in reconnaissance missions.\n\n\nArchaeological attempts to identify ancient defence walls in China using remote sensing technology: Yue-ping & Lin, 2009\nSeveral studies have attempted to develop understandings of the structure and role of ancient defences walls in China, a key part of national defence history. Yue-ping & Lin, 2009 reviewed the use of these technologies in archeological work and describe how integral they are to contemporary digs.\n\n\nAttempts to measure xenophobia and global inequality: Mirza et al., 2021\nMirza et al., 2021 outline a novel methodology that seeks to quantify xenophobia and global inequality more broadly through remotely sensed data regarding average nighttime light emitted per person. They found a significant relationship between the resulting light-based inequality indicator and existing estimates of net income inequality.\n\n\nUsing USV to develop navigational and bathymetric charts of yacht ports: Specht et al., 2020\nSpecht et al., 2020 argue that modern yacht ports should primarily provide vessels with navigational safety associated with their maneuvering on the approach fairway. On this basis, they employ a methodology that uses an unnamed surface vehicle (USV) to aim to define and develop unique bathymetric and navigational charts of the harbor and the approach fairway.\n\n\nUsing satellite images to predict the effects of environmental change on zebra migration: Bartlam-Brooks et al., 2013\nHabitat loss in the Anthropocene has threatened historical zebra migrations. As a result, identifying and prioritizing migration routes for conservation has taken on a new urgency. In response to this, Bartlam-Brooks et al., 2013 utilised observations of precipitation from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission data set and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer-derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) to track daily zebra movements in Botswana.\n\n\n\nIn future weeks, I will focus on fewer studies and analyse them in greater depth. However for this week, I just wanted to read as much as possible and push the boat out in terms of what I knew and what was possible - so stay tuned!"

    "text": "1.3 Reflections\nI really enjoyed this introduction week! It was good to return to concepts I’d forgotten about since I last did any remote sensing and I particularly enjoyed playing around with SNAP in the practical. Not only was the process of making my summary sheet good fun (and a welcome respite from other writing/coding heavy assessments), but also a chance to remind myself of some key definitions. Specifically, I’d forgotten about all the different kinds of atmospheric corrections as in the past I’d applied mostly Raleigh corrections to data so that felt valuable ahead of week 3 which this week’s lecture mentioned would involve more information on. I also had a lot of fun pushing myself to comb through past literature and see the plethora of ways and contexts in which remote sensing data has been applied - I found the studies about adolescent behaviours, the egg industry and forced labour camps to be particularly fascinating. Whilst I have no doubt that in future weeks I will probably return to the comfort of exploring environmental applications of satellite data, this has sparked some ideas for potential topics to explore perhaps for the group project and I look forward to the rest of the course!"

    "text": "4.1 Summary\n\n4.1.1 Nairobi, Kenya; the rapidly urbanising ‘Silicon-Savannah’\nNairobi is the capital and largest city in Kenya, containing a current population of nearly 4.5 million (Hey, 2023).\n\n\n\nAerial image of Nairobi, Kenya (2016). Source: Landsat-8, NASA\n\n\nLike many cities in Africa, Nairobi has experienced unprecedented urbanisation in the 21st century which has triggered many positive consequences including a rapidly expanding economy (particularly driven by an explosion in the city’s tech industry earning Nairobi the nickname ‘Silicon-Savannah’), economic advancement and growing global influence (UN Habitat, 2006, Switzerland Global Enterprise, 2021). Simultaneously however, uncontrolled urbanisation has also triggered a host of new socio-economic and environmental challenges that have posed (among many things) a serious strain on existing infrastructure, a reduction in environmental quality and record-high unemployment (Nato et al., 2023).\nOf the negative consequences brought about by urbanisation, air quality in Nairobi has experienced perhaps the greatest hit, representing a serious environmental challenge that is only set to worsen with forecasted population growth.\n\n\n4.1.2 Air quality degradation: causes, consequences and challenges\nIn 2019, air pollution in Nairobi was 4.2 times higher than WHO recommended average annual concentration levels; an achievement which has been consistently reported since 2001 (Clean Air Fund, 2023, ASAP Report, 2019). This is result of both formal and informal activities, with the three largest sectoral contributors being road transport, solid waste mismanagement and biomass fuels (see pie chart below for full breakdown).\n\n\n\nPM2.5 Exposure estimates by sectoral source contributors. Source: McDuffie et al. 2021 via Clean Air Fund, 2023\n\n\nCurrently, the city only has one active air pollution monitoring site (located near Jomo Kenyatta airport) which limits opportunities to conduct spatio-temporal analyses of air pollution and instead forces a dependence on short term, ad hoc monitoring studies (Kinney et al.,2012, Nairobi City Council, 2018). Despite a lack of records however, the effects of pollution have not gone unnoticed. Both short and long term respiratory illnesses including pneumonia and lung cancer represent significant public health problems, with three in every ten hospital visits in the capital being attributed to respiratory infections linked to air pollution (Briton, 2023).\nThe Kenyan national government sought to respond to this by developing strict Air Quality Regulations for the country in 2014. However, high levels of governmental corruption and financial mismanagement saw little implementation of these regulations and instead the document became used for referencing purposes (ASAP Report, 2019). It was evident that city councilors alone would struggle to implement action, and that international cooperation was necessary for instigating change. It was in this landscape that the 2019 Air Quality Action Plan was announced; an ambitious collaboration between the Kenyan national government, the UN Environment Agency and the Environmental Compliance Institute.\n\n\n4.1.3 The Air Quality Action Plan (2019-2023)\nThis plan seeks to support Nairobi City County to develop better air quality management strategies, with the overall objective of building improved capacity to develop, implement and enforce policy and regulatory frameworks for air quality management across the capital (Nairobi City Council, 2018). The fixed time period for this plan is 2019-2023, however it was hoped that following the official action ‘end date’ that objectives would remain a top governmental priority. The plan has four main objectives, detailed in the table below.\n\nBroadly, these aims can be put in 3 overarching categories:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObjective\nStrategy\n\n\n\n\n\nBuild scientific evidence for policy/legislative interventions for air quality management\n\nUndertake an inventory of the air pollutants and emission sources that most contribute to poor air quality in Nairobi City\n\n\n\nRaise public awareness on the health/environmental impacts of air pollution\n\nDeploy effective communication on the health and environmental impacts of air pollution, mitigation options and benefits\n\n\n\nDevelop effective approaches for air quality management\n\nAdopt policy, legislative and regulatory options for air management that incorporate mandatory requirements, voluntary and market based approaches\n\n\n\nBuild an effective implementation/enforcement programme for air quality legislation\n\nEnhance the capacity of NCCG for implementation and enforcement programme for Nairobi City’s air quality legislation\n\n\n\n\nImproving current monitoring capacity\nEducation\nImplementation/enforcement\n\nThese objectives are closely linked to several of the UN Sustainable Development Goals, the most relevant of which are presented in the figure below. Specifically, Nairobi’s Action Plan mirrors the aim outlined in Target 3.9 under Goal 3 which focuses on reducing the number of deaths and illnesses from hazardous chemicals and air, water, and soil pollution and contamination.\n\n\n\nRelevant UN Sustainable Development Goals. Source: UN SDGs\n\n\nWhilst the action plan demonstrated a growing concern towards air quality and an escalated government focus on pollution, the objectives have not been addressed with equal success. The ASAP briefing (led by the UK Government) found approaches to traffic management and reducing emissions by cars to be effective and multifaceted, with implementation plans scheduled for the present decade (ASAP Report, 2019). Similarly, outreach and education programs appear to have had a degree of success as indicated in studies such as that by Kamau, 2016. By contrast however, less attention was given to reducing pollution caused by poor waste management and the burning of waste (both in residential areas and in the city’s main rubbish dump, Dandora Landfill) remains a pressing problem.\nThat the action plan has thus far failed to address this problem of waste management, despite it being a major source of pollutants demonstrates the necessity for new suggested approaches to tackle the problem. Currently, there is no information online about how the city seeks to tackle this problem beyond issuing penalties to those caught in the act of burning, which in itself is a rarely utilised approach (Kamau, 2016). In the following section I shall outline a method which relies on freely available EO data to address this; a method which I believe, if implemented, could offer an effective and low-cost solution to the current problem reported across Nairobi."

    "text": "4.2 Applications\n\n4.2.1 Waste management and illegal burning: the problem\nA serious problem in Nairobi is the illegal dumping and burning of waste. Every day, the city generates 3000 tonnes of solid municipal waste, of which 62% is illegally disposed of (dumped on the side of the road + burnt). This generates an estimated 25% of Nairobi’s PM2.5 concentrations and thus represents a key source of air pollutants. Further information on this problem can be found here: City residents’ lives at risk over open burning of waste\n\n\n\nSource: Limo/Tearfund for The Guardian, 2023\n\n\nCurrently, local authorities are charged with the responsibility of collecting and disposing of solid municipal waste within their area of jurisdiction, and are granted powers to issue minimum fines of KSH 500,000 ($3,500) or imprison offenders by up to 6 months. Presently however, rubbish collection is extremely poor, with many areas never being served or only once in several months (Muniafu & Otiato, 2010). This is attributed to failings by government authorities above local councilors to monitor and enforce waste management responsibilities; a case which is worsened by severe financial mismanagement (Henry et al., 2006). To take matters into their own hands, many individuals in residential areas move waste to the roadside and burn it, producing clouds of toxic noxious fumes (Muniafu & Otiato, 2010).\n\n\n4.2.2 Waste management and illegal burning: the proposed solution\nGiven the evident legal loopholes and broken accountability system for waste in the city, I suggest that the problem could be best addressed through the creation of an impartial watchdog body who monitor the location of burnt waste through satellite imagery. Instead of penalising individuals who resort to burning waste as a last-ditch scenario when local authorities fail to do their job, this watchdog could report its findings to the national government and identify which local authorities have the worst performance in regards to waste removal.\nThe idea for this came from my knowledge of past studies that utilise a Normalised Burn Ratio Index to monitor the severity of (typically) forest fires (EG. Lu et al.,2015 Giddey et al., 2022, Alcaras et al., 2022). These papers used freely available satellite imagery (EG. Sentinel-2) to derive an index for fire severity that allows the location and intensity of fires to be mapped. This served as inspiration for me as it demonstrated the potential for methodologies to monitor fire using remote sensing to be employed even where budgets for accessing expensive high spectral/spatial/temporal imagery do not exist. From this starting point, I began to investigate whether similar methods had been employed in the detection of illegal fires/burning.\nI found Nádudvari et al.’s 2021 paper to be valuable in considering viable methodologies. They were able to identify the location of self-heating coal waste (a precursor to coal dump fires) in Polish and Ukranian mining regions by creating a self heating intensity index that used band math on selected cloud-free Landsat images. The full details of their methodology are outlined in section 3.1 of the paper: Classification of fires in coal waste dumps based on Landsat, Aster thermal bands and thermal camera in Polish and Ukrainian mining regions but broadly, the study depended on the thermal infrared sensors of satellite images taken by Landsat and applied ASTER, ‘the cost-effective and time-saving technique for monitoring coal waste fires and detecting their thermal anomalies’.\n\n\n\n‘Three representative coal waste dumps as examples of how the SHII index was calculated’. Source: Nádudvari et al., 2021\n\n\nAlthough the limitations of their method are described in the paper (namely, they tried to use a combination of images obtained by different Landsat satellites which led to issues when comparing images against one another), they found Landsat 7 ETM+ to be the most effective sensor for their purposes. This is valuable insight in regards to opportunities for remote sensing in Nairobi as attempts to monitor fires could start by applying a similar methodology on imagery obtained by just this sensor. However, most waste burning occurs at night time in Nairobi to avoid detection (Clean Air Fund, 2023), and given that night-time Landsat images are rare (Nádudvari et al., 2021), this method may require supplementation by images that are obtained at night - in their case, they did this by using capturing images using a drone at night.\nA more sophisticated methodology for detecting waste burning (as well as illegal dumping more generally) was outlined in a proof-of-concept article by The California Integrated Waste Management Board (CIWMB, 2005). They were able to identify the location of illegal waste tire piles by using high spatial resolution satellite imagery (Multispectral Ikonos) across 4 small areas with a combined area of &gt;50km2 in California. Their method involved the use of visual analysis and an automated Tire Identification from Reflectance (TIRe) model to find possible waste tire piles - the model was a univariate decision tree which used the spectral characteristics of tires to segment possible tire features from the remaining image. The model was successful, proving capable of identifying 15 tire piles (2 of which were previously unknown to the CIWMB) and returning only one false positive. Unlike the research by Nádudvari, the CIWMB paper demonstrated the opportunity to identify much smaller objects from satellite data. However, whilst Landsat data is freely available, Ikonos sits behind a pay wall, which may affect the feasibility of its use in the case of Nairobi where government budgets are stretched and misused. Nonetheless, CIWMD’s findings demonstrate a proven, alternative approach to identifying waste + burning using remote sensing data which could be adapted for use by the Nairobi government.\nA final approach which has been outlined in past literature was developed by Scott et al.,2023, who identified instances of illegal waste burning in the Maldieves through the development of a machine learning approach. Specifically, they used an ‘image classification and semantic segmentation model based on a pretrained convolutional neural network to identify and locate plumes within images’. They fed three-band (RGB), 3m/pixel images from Planet satellites into their model and found their classification model to achieve a training accuracy of 96% and a validation accuracy of 83%. Scott’s research indicates ever-expanding opportunities to utilise new technologies to detect fires more accurately than ever before.\n\n\n\nSuccessful model outputs versus visually identified plumes. Source: Scott et al. 2023\n\n\nOf the three methods outlined in this section, Scott et al.,’s 2023 represents the most complex. Unlike Nádudvari et al.’s 2021 paper, opportunities to reproduce Scott et al.,’s work is potentially more limited as it would require a greater technological capacity and people knowledgeable in the use of machine learning - several parts of the methodology went over my head! That isn’t to say it cannot be used - if funding was available and specialists were employed, this method would be an incredibly valuable way of monitoring burnt waste across Nairobi. However, as mentioned previously, it is unclear as to whether this is feasible given financial constraints. Therefore, in an ideal world it would be great to see a methodology like that used by Scott et al., 2023 to identifying poor waste management in local authorities across Nairobi, but it may be that an approach like that used by Nádudvari et al., 2021 or CIWMB, 2005 is more suitable.\nIt is important to note that these papers represent just three ways of identifying waste mismanagement contributing to air pollution from satellite imagery - other methodologies are outlined elsewhere! Instead of outlining a singular method, I hope this section has effectively communicated the fact that there is a wide range of ways of monitoring this pollution-contributor; each with a range of pros and cons."

    "text": "4.3 Reflection\nBefore settling on Nairobi’s Air Quality Action Plan I did quite a lot of preliminary research into different metropolitan development plans and had no idea quite how many there were. Coming from a strictly quantitative physical geography background I had never really researched urban development before and found it particularly surprising to see how many frameworks overlapped with one another on spatial and temporal scales. If I’m being honest, this made me feel quite disillusioned with the idea that many of them are actually effective; I’m sure this is quite a generic realisation, but one which took me this long to come to. Another thing that I noticed was how wildly varied the quality of plans could be - comparing Nairobi’s lackluster Air Quality plan to something detailed and solution-focused like the Ahmedabad Heat-Health Action Plan (Knowlton et al.,2014) was valuable in demonstrating what makes a framework useful in practice rather than just serving as a reference document. It was probably from this realisation that I became so invested in the week’s task; I really enjoyed the creativity that had to go into imagining usable and actionable solutions to recognised problems. It was particularly satisfying to come up with ideas that involved the use of EO data, only to find that similar research had been conducted elsewhere that found the methods to be viable and effective. I really experienced this when I came across Scott et al.,’s 2023 paper in the Maldives as this was the idea I had been skirting around when reading other papers.\nBeyond my personal reflections, I also want to add some reflections on the case of Nairobi itself. Although I do think that my proposed solutions could be theoretically used to accomplish some of the objectives outlined the city’s Action Plan, I’m also conscious of the fact that they’re incredibly ambitious and probably unrealistic. This is not due to limitiations in methodologies or data availability; rather, in virtually all of the literature I read I was constantly reminded of the corruption and financial mismanagement that plagues not only Nairobi but all levels of Kenya’s systems of governance. Therefore whilst it is totally feasible that a watchdog is set up and EO data is used for monitoring, I’m not sure that the resulting findings would do much to crack down on those responsible for air pollution. Instead, I fear that it would serve as another financial drain. Hopefully this is just my pessimism talking, as I would love to see novel uses of EO data outlined in scientific papers be used in practice to enact change."

    "text": "1.2 Applications\nComing from a background in remote sensing for environmental monitoring that has seen me use SNAP & R quite extensively, I decided it best to dedicate my study time in week 1 to consider applications of remote sensing data that I was unfamiliar with. Quite often during my undergraduate degree I found myself falling into a trap of believing that anything that lay beyond the confines of strictly quantitative and highly scientific research was a waste of time and not worth paying attention to. Only now that I’ve graduated am I realising how narrow-minded and naive this perspective is; it really came to mind when during the lecture we were reminded that given the plethora of potential applications of remotely sensed data, there is no singular best sensor or optimum spatial/spectral/temporal resolution. \nSo, in an attempt to fix my old way of thinking, I am starting off CASA0023 and this learning diary by researching applications of remote sensing that sit beyond the confines of physical geography. To have some fun with it, I decided to try and find an example of a time remotely sensed data was used to address an unusual topic for every letter of the alphabet. I used a random word generator (https://randomwordgenerator.com/) to offer me a word which served as the starting point of my research. Below I have provided a brief description of articles that I came across during my research, many of which prompted me to fall down a rabbit hole of literature that I’d never come across before.\n\nABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUvWXYZ\n\n\nAdolescent vulnerability in Indonesia: Toharudin et al., 2024\nToharudin et al., 2024 examined mental health issues in adolescents in Indonesia by combining a variety of variables including mobile phone usage, emotional disorder classifications, travel experiences as well as night light remote sensing data to see how behavioural disorders varied between young people in urban versus rural areas.\n\n\nClassifying punches in Olympic boxing using static RGB cameras: Stefański et al., 2023\nStefański et al., 2023 sought to propose a solution to address current issues regarding the classification of punches in Olympic boxing by using static RGB cameras opposite the ring to track and then classify athlete moves. This challenged conventional approaches to track athletes in combat sports that see athletes require wearable sensors.\n\n\nOn-site cocaine detection with an integrated near-infrared spectral sensor: Kranenburg et al., 2022\nIn response to the all-time high of illegal drug production/trafficking/seizures/usage, Kranenburg et al., 2022 explore the concept of an on-site drug detection device that uses a NIR spectral sensor that can be integrated into a smart phone. Their testing found the sensor to successfully exploit an array of resonant-cavity enhanced photodetectors to correctly classify 11 common illicit drugs 100% of the time. This is achieved by chemometric modelling of the response of 15 wavelength-specific pixels (chemometric is just a fancy word for mathematical methods that analyse chemical data).\n\n\nDinosaur fossils discovered using remotely piloted aircraft systems: Herridge-Berry et al., 2021\nDigging for dinosaur remains is limited by the typically inaccessible terrain surrounding potential archeological sites. Herridge-Berry et al., 2021 however offer a proof-of-concept test for the remote sensing of fossils (specifically ‘vertebrate boneheads’) in Dinosaur Provincial Park, Alberta as the case study. Due to the small size of most fossils, they suggest using Spectral Mixture Analysis after collecting data obtained by deploying a RGB camera onto a plane flying over a study site.\n\n\nAdvancing the egg industry using non-destructive optical sensing technologies: Ahmed et al. 2023\nIn acknowledgement of eggs being one of the best sources of protein and one of the most popular foods worldwide, Ahmed et al. 2023 wrote a review of ways in which technologies including satellites in space and remote sensors are currently used (and can in future be used) to turn the current egg industry into ‘Industry 4.0’.\n\n\nPredicting the distribution potential of an invasive frog in Hawaii using remotely sensed data: Bisrat et al., 2011\nBisrat et al., 2011 used 5 biophysical variables derived from MODIS as predictors for the potential distribution of Eleutherodactylus coqui (commonly known as the coqui frog), a species native to Puerto Rico but non-native and dangerous to ecological systems in Hawaii.\n\n\nIntegrating remote sensing for mapping garbage dump areas in Bahrain: Al-Joburi, 2017\nGarbage dumping is a prevalent issue in Bahrain, associated with worrying economic and environmental consequences. In response to this issue, Al-Joburi, 2017 was able to identify, locate and map possible garbage dump sites using Landsat imagery spanning 1972 to the present day.\n\n\nRemote sensing via hot air balloon across Yellowstone National Park: Planer-Friedrich et al. 2006\nTwo rapidly changing hydrothermal areas in Yellowstone National Park required mapping and monitoring, however limited budgets, a lack of personnel trained in remote sensing and strict unmanned UAV rules in USA were holding back observation efforts and management strategy implementation. Planer-Friedrich et al. 2006 responded to this by using a hot air balloon to take photos from above the areas.\n\n\nEstimating the population size of endangered iguanas in the Galápagos using drones: Varela-Jaramillo et al., 2023\nVarela-Jaramillo et al., 2023 outline the development of a drone-based method for the estimation of population size in Galápagos marine iguanas, Amblyrhynchus cristatus, finding drone-based surveys to outperform ground-based counts in all tests.\n\n\nMicrowave remote sensing of Jupiter’s atmosphere from an orbiting spacecraft: Janssen et al., 2005\nJanssen et al., 2005 demonstrate the promise of passive microwave sounding via an orbiting spacecraft to determine deep water stores in Jupiter to an accuracy that enables the discrimination of models for Jupiter’s origin.\n\n\nEstimating the Leaf Area Index (LAI) for ketchup farms using remote sensing images: Dorneles et al., 2023\nLAI is one of the main physiological parameters of the plant related to transpiration, productivity and rainfall interception. Dorneles et al., 2023 sought to measure LAI of an industrial tomato field used in ketchup production in Brazil using Sentinel-2 images so as to incorporate the parameter into improved agricultural efficiency plans.\n\n\nSatellite remote sensing informing evidence based action against forced labour camps: Boyd et al., 2018\nBoyd et al., 2018 use WorldView imagery available on Google Earth geobrowser to identify and estimate the number of brick kilns across the ‘Brick Belt’ that runs across south Asia - kilns which are known sites of modern day slavery.\n\n\nRemote sensing in movies\nAs a big movie fan, it felt only right to give Will Smith’s 1998 Enemy of the State a mention; a film which is an attempt (albeit incredibly over-the-top) the demonstrate the power of remote sensing and satellites. It’s a surveillance police state thriller which has all kinds of scenes which see satellite imagery used to track fugitives across the US.\n\n\nEstimating chlorophyll concentration in conifer needles: Moorthy et al., 2008\nNo longer is it impossible to find a needle in a haystack; Moorthy et al., 2008 were able to detect and measure the chlorophyll concentration in Jack Pine needles, a dominant Boreal forest species using Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI) observations obtained in the visible-near infrared domain across 8 sites in Ontario, Canada.\n\n\nEstimating the phenological stages of oranges in Iranian orchards using remote sensing: Hashemi et al., 2021\nHashemi et al., 2021 looked to better constrain the growth of orange trees to improve agricultural models and production lines by utilising MODIS images to track the phenological stages of crops across the southeast of Fars Province in Iran.\n\n\nTracking pirates from space: Shortland, 2012\nPiracy off the shores of Somalia remains a significant issue; one which requires a land-based solution. Shortland, 2012 approaches this by suggesting a host of solutions, all of which use a variety of satellite remote sensing based methods. These look at both tracking ships remotely, as well as looking at night-time light data to pinpoint suspected beneficiaries of piracy ransom money.\n\n\nReducing traffic queue times using satellite imagery: Leitloff et al., 2007\nLeitloff et al., 2007 utilised the fine 1 metre resolution of QuickBird imagery to detect vehicle queues in urban areas to demonstrate the opportunities to use this information to reroute traffic and reduce queuing time.\n\n\nRemote sensors as an integral element of modern race car driving: Wojciechowski & Wojtowicz, 2023\nWojciechowski & Wojtowicz, 2023 describe the over 250 active remote sensors placed on Formula 1 cars during Grand Prix races that allow teams to generate over 500GB of data. Each sensor is assigned to one of three categories: control, instrumentation, and monitoring.\n\n\nAdvancements in remote sensing facilitating improved oil spill surveillance: Jha et al., 2008\nOil spill surveillance constitutes an important component of oil spill disaster management. Jha et al., 2008 reviewed the benefits of various remote sensors and satellites that are currently employed in surveillance efforts; an integral part of environmental management and industrial accountability.\n\n\nEstimation of tree cover using MODIS data at global, continental and regional/local scales: Hansen et al., 2005\nIt would be wrong to include anything other than trees for T, and Hansen et al., 2005 research which utilised MODIS data to map tree covers at different scales of study.\n\n\nManaging urbanisation using remote sensing: Rosni et al., 2016\nRosni et al., 2016 monitor urban sprawl across Kuala Lumpur metropolitan area using SPOT-5 images to demonstrate the rapid urbanisation rate affecting Indonesia.\n\n\nDetection of submerged ocean vessels using remote sensing techniques: Wren et al., 1997\nWren et al., 1997 described how remote sensing techniques can provide not only an aid but also a valuable alternative to approaches at detecting and recovering submerged vessels. Specifically, they identify the value of elevated sensors on Low Earth Orbit satellites as a powerful tool in reconnaissance missions.\n\n\nArchaeological attempts to identify ancient defence walls in China using remote sensing technology: Yue-ping & Lin, 2009\nSeveral studies have attempted to develop understandings of the structure and role of ancient defences walls in China, a key part of national defence history. Yue-ping & Lin, 2009 reviewed the use of these technologies in archeological work and describe how integral they are to contemporary digs.\n\n\nAttempts to measure xenophobia and global inequality: Mirza et al., 2021\nMirza et al., 2021 outline a novel methodology that seeks to quantify xenophobia and global inequality more broadly through remotely sensed data regarding average nighttime light emitted per person. They found a significant relationship between the resulting light-based inequality indicator and existing estimates of net income inequality.\n\n\nUsing USV to develop navigational and bathymetric charts of yacht ports: Specht et al., 2020\nSpecht et al., 2020 argue that modern yacht ports should primarily provide vessels with navigational safety associated with their maneuvering on the approach fairway. On this basis, they employ a methodology that uses an unnamed surface vehicle (USV) to aim to define and develop unique bathymetric and navigational charts of the harbor and the approach fairway.\n\n\nUsing satellite images to predict the effects of environmental change on zebra migration: Bartlam-Brooks et al., 2013\nHabitat loss in the Anthropocene has threatened historical zebra migrations. As a result, identifying and prioritizing migration routes for conservation has taken on a new urgency. In response to this, Bartlam-Brooks et al., 2013 utilised observations of precipitation from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission data set and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer-derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) to track daily zebra movements in Botswana.\n\n\n\nIn future weeks, I will focus on fewer studies and analyse them in greater depth. However for this week, I just wanted to read as much as possible and push the boat out in terms of what I knew and what was possible - so stay tuned!"

    "text": "1.3 Reflections\nI really enjoyed this introduction week! It was good to return to concepts I’d forgotten about since I last did any remote sensing and I particularly enjoyed playing around with SNAP in the practical. Not only was the process of making my summary sheet good fun (and a welcome respite from other writing/coding heavy assessments), but also a chance to remind myself of some key definitions. Specifically, I’d forgotten about all the different kinds of atmospheric corrections as in the past I’d applied mostly Raleigh corrections to data so that felt valuable ahead of week 3 which this week’s lecture mentioned would involve more information on. I also had a lot of fun pushing myself to comb through past literature and see the plethora of ways and contexts in which remote sensing data has been applied - I found the studies about adolescent behaviours, the egg industry and forced labour camps to be particularly fascinating. Whilst I have no doubt that in future weeks I will probably return to the comfort of exploring environmental applications of satellite data, this has sparked some ideas for potential topics to explore perhaps for the group project and I look forward to the rest of the course!"

Very infrequently do I hear mention of female scientists so I always find it exciting to learn more about their work and role in scientific history. In one obituary I found this snippet to be particularly amusing. The article discusses how many scientists within the NASA x Geological Survey team were skeptical that her multispectral scanner invention would work, believing it to be too clunky and inefficient. Upon it proving to work and Landsat’s subsequent send-off into space, a geologist who was vocally skeptical of the technology was recorded saying “I was so wrong about this. I’m not going to eat crow. Not big enough. I’m going to eat raven.”. \n\n\n\nNorwood amongst her colleagues at NASA (Source: NASA Goddard)\n\n\nThat comment, along with the photo of her at work surrounded by a group of male scientists (above) really resonated with me. I highly recommend reading this obituary (linked below), as it details the lifetime of gender-based obstacles she faced. Norwood really seems like a legend. \nVirginia Norwood New York Times obituary (2023)"

    "text": "3.2 Applications\nThere is a lot that could be potentially investigated in-depth from this week’s lecture, so to narrow down the task I decided to focus my research on band ratioing as this is a technique I’ve used fairly extensively in the past and find most interesting. Specifically, I wanted to return to a paper that I discovered during my undergraduate degree which inspired me greatly and consider the methods employed in their research in the context of this week’s taught content.\n\n3.2.1 Band ratio: a closer look\nAs defined by Shahi et al., (2023) in their review of remote sensing methods, band ratioing is ‘a technique in which DN values in one spectral band is divided from the corresponding values in another band’, creating an output known as a ‘ratioed image’ or simply the band ratio. This technique enhances spectral characteristics of specific features in an image, regardless of variation in scene illumination. It is often used for change detection when applied to multitemporal data and has been used in contexts of deforestation, hydrology, agriculture, cryosphere monitoring among others. \nProbably the most commonly used band ratio is NDVI, the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index. This index is computed as the difference between near-infrared (NIR) and red reflectance divided by their sum (Gessesse et al., 2019). It is represented by the following formula: \n\nLow NDVI values indicate moisture-stressed vegetation whilst higher values indicate a higher density of green vegetation, as represented in the diagram below.\n\n\n\nNDVI diagram. Source: EOS Data Analytics, 2019\n\n\nAs mentioned above, most uses of NDVI that I found across past literature are in the context of deforestation (EG. Othman et al., 2018 in Malaysia, Muñoz Peña et al., 2015 in Peru, Ngigi et al., 2004 in Kenya etc.) and have demonstrated the power of using band ratioing to monitor landscape change over time. However, uses of NDVI have not been limited to forested regions. \n\n\n3.2.2 Antarctica going green\nDuring my undergraduate degree I was lucky enough to attend a lecture delivered by Dr Andrew Gray, a glacial biogeochemist specialising in the use of remote sensing to monitor polar environments. Until this point I had been exposed to NDVI several times (predominantly in the context of monitoring Scottish forests), but never beyond this. In Andrew’s talk he explained the research he was doing in Antarctica studying seasonal recurrent algal blooming that was transforming the otherwise white swathes of ice into multicoloured landscapes. In his research, he sought to monitor these blooms - believed to be lowering the surface albedo and thus contributing significantly to glacial ablation - by collecting spectral measurements during fieldwork in Antarctica and relating these to satellite imagery back in the lab. \n\n\n\n50m x 100m green snow algal bloom in Antarctica. Source: Gray et al. 2020\n\n\nThis research was published in his jointly authored 2020 paper, in which he describes the correction and image enhancement methods that were used - all of which were mentioned in this week’s taught content. These include orthorectification, atmospheric correction, masking and filtering as well as the application of band math. Finally, to identify algae across the ice they used used the spectral measurements obtained in the field and compared these with the NDVI results from band ratioing of the Sentinel-2 imagery used to estimate algal bloom coverage. Their research identified 1679 individual blooms, averaging 1043 m2, but spanning 300 m2 to 145,000m2. Moreover, they estimated the carbon content of these blooms to be equivalent to 479 tonnes of carbon within a growth season. \n\n\n\nOverview of the locations of individual blooms of green-dominant snow algae identified across the Antarctic Peninsula using modelled data from satellite imagery and ground data. Source: Gray et al., 2020\n\n\nI found it really interesting to learn about how NDVI could be applied in polar regions and was encouraged by the success of this study! However, I did find it interesting that Gray et al.,noted problems in using NDVI to identify red algae in this paper - they attributed this to limited band sensitivity that hindered the detection of red algae. Ultimately, this means that the number of blooms that they were able to identify was not representative of all blooms, but rather specifically green algal blooms. This was actually a limitation which was addressed in a following paper published by Gray et al.,in 2021, in which they applied NDVI to WorldView imagery that, after performing a spectral angle mapper classification in ENVI had better sensitivity to red algae than the Sentinel-2 imagery used in their original 2020 study. This methodology returned greater results as all algae species were able to be detected (see below).\n\n\n\nMapped red and green snow algal distribution and modelled cell density obtained through NDVI + field data across Anchorage Island, Antarctica. Source: Gray et al., 2021\n\n\nOne additional thing unrelated to NDVI that came up in my re-reading of Gray’s research that I was reminded of during this week’s lecture was the radiative transfer model he used to perform atmospheric correction in his research. Before this point, I knew that atmospheric correction was essential, but understood little about the mechanisms by which it worked let alone the variety of models that exist to perform corrections. I discovered that almost all quality models (EG. 6S, FLAASH, MODTRAN, ACOLITE etc.) are incredibly expensive and of the freely available models (Sen2Cor for S2 data, Py6S and a personal enemy of mine, iCOR which refuses to work on SNAP without crashing) none are particularly user-friendly or of a high quality. This is unfortunate given the free availability of quality imagery and represents to me a significant issue existing in the remote sensing world. It would be nice to see either improved compatibility between freely available models and GIS programmes or a reduction in the cost of quality models. It would also be great to see more models develop specifically for compatibility with Google Earth Engine as I believe this to be a key player in the future of remote sensing. \nSince my initial introduction to the use of band ratios in cryosphere research 2022, I was pleased to see the number of studies that have continued to use NDVIs to monitor vegetation (EG. Carlson et al., 2023, Fonesca et al., 2023, Cannone et al., 2023). I hope in future this continues and for my Masters dissertation I am keen to return to band ratioing once again and explore further how it can be used as a valuable tool in detecting landscape change over time."

    "text": "3.3 Reflection\nIt was fun to think back on past work I’d read and undertaken myself this week, as I hadn’t thought much about image processing since April 2023. Although I pretty much entirely focused on band ratioing (and mentioned atmospheric correction briefly) in this diary entry, I also found it useful this week to be reminded of image enhancement techniques.\nIn particular, I’d forgotten about Principal Component Analysis, a technique which I’m sure in future I will need to use. I hadn’t realised until this week how easy R Studio made it to perform PCA using the prcomp() function in the terra package; something which I want to make a note of here so I don’t forget. Moreover, it was useful to be explained texture analysis properly as before this week I had never formally come across it. I ended up having an interesting conversation about it with my flatmate who’s training to become a radiologist and had no idea how involved it was in medical practice - I’d only ever thought about it before in the context of remote sensing! \nWhilst I didn’t give the practicals as much time as I would’ve liked to this week due to other assessments being due (and my fear of the long processing times involved in performing techniques like PCA), I enjoyed looking through the code provided in the notes and have no doubt that I will be returning to this in future when I conduct research of my own. I must say though, having processed satellite imagery on SNAP/ENVI/R Studio versus Google Earth Engine, I feel grateful to be studying at a time of growing cloud computing as I find GEE much easier to use - this has me really excited for week 5!"
