# Xaringan

This week we were tasked with familiarising ourselves with Xaringan and Quarto, neither of which I have ever come across before. For my presentation, I decided to return to my cryospheric roots by researching ICESat-2, a lidar satellite I've briefly used during my undergraduate degree and have seen mentioned in many a paper. A summary of the sensor, a brief foray into its published applications and a reflection on its contributions are outlined in the Xaringan presentation embedded below.
