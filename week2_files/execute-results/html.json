For my presentation, I decided to return to my cryospheric roots by researching ICESat-2, a lidar satellite I've briefly used during my undergraduate degree and have seen mentioned in many a paper. A summary of the sensor, a brief foray into its published applications and a reflection on its contributions are outlined in the Xaringan presentation embedded below.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n```{=html}\n<div class=\"shareagain\" style=\"min-width:300px;margin:1em auto;\" data-exeternal=\"1\">\n<iframe src=\"https://dkpw9.github.io/xaringan/\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" style=\"border:2px solid currentColor;\" loading=\"lazy\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<script>fitvids('.shareagain', {players: 'iframe'});</script>\n</div>\n```\n:::\n:::\n",
